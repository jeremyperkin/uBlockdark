# uBlockdark
Dark theme for uBlock Origin

Candidate v.01 has been created.

PLEASE FOLLOW THE BELOW INSTRUCTIONS! -

One person who could not read wiped out their install and lost all their filters.   

r/mvus

Don't be like this user!  Make sure to BACKUP!!

Files that have been altered in someway have only been placed in the repo.
  * Should you wish to use them - just ensure to backup your current copy of the 
  uBLOCK folder found in your extension folder.  Afterwards just paste the code into the appropriate files you currently have.
  
Note - This is a work in progress. Color scheme and variable names could be changed at any time.   

Everything has been tested and appears to be what I hope to be incorportated fully at some point.

Feel free to add your comments or wish list.
